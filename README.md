# My-Projects
This repositoary contains some of the programs (in the C language) that I have written. First, KMPStringSearch is my implementation of the Knuth Morris Pratt Pattern Searching Algorithm. Second, OwnQsort is my implementation of the Quick Sort Algorithm. Third, WeightedGraphTraversal is a program that finds the shortest distance from one node to another in a weighted graph.
